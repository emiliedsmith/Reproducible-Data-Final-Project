# Reproducible-Data-Final-Project
### The purpose of this project is to analyze the health and economic impact of weather events accross the USA from 1950 to 2011 using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database.

### This database collects characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, property and crop damage starting in the year 1950 and ending in November 2011.

### After cleaning the data and grouping by type of event, the total number of fatalities, injuries, property damages and crop damages for each category are shown in 2 separate panels. Overall, tornadoes cause the largest number of injuries and fatalities, while floods cause the most property damage, and drought causes the most damage to crops.
